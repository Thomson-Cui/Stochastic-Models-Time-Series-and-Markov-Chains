# STAT 432: Stochastic Models: Time Series and Markov Chains
## Course Description:
Introduction to stochastic modeling of data. Emphasis on models and statistical analysis of data with a significant temporal and/or spatial structure.  This course will analyze time and space dependent random phenomena from two perspectives: Stationary Time Series: Spectral representation of deterministic signals, autocorrelation. Power spectra.  Transmission of stationary signals through linear filters. Optimal filter design, signal-to-noise ratio.  Gaussian signals and correlation matrices. Spectral representation and computer simulation of stationary signals. Discrete Markov Chains: Transition matrices, recurrences and the first step analysis. Steady rate. Recurrence and ergodicity, empirical averages. Long run behavior, convergence to steady state.  Time to absorption.  Eigenvalues and nonhomogeneous Markov chains.  Introduction to Gibbs fields and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).
